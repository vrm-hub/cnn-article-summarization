      "\n",
      "The bright-eyed teenager lives in a sepia-toned village in the province of Qena, a place of rural poverty and neglect. But she has big dreams about education. She wants to open a school one day.\n",

      "Two and a half years after the country's uprising began, Egypt's fledgling democracy is stillborn, stubbornly stuck between its past and future.

      "In the World Economic Forum's latest report on global competitiveness, Egypt ranked near the bottom -- 131st out of 144 countries -- for quality of primary education. Egypt's literacy rate is 66%, according to a 2011 United Nations report. Meanwhile, a report by London think tank Chatham House says just $129 a year is spent on each Egyptian student; the United States, for example, spends 40 times as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation is worst in regions far from the capital, and in Upper Egypt, where more than half the population is under 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many schools look more like rank penitentiaries rather than hubs of learning. Students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration.\n",

      "And forget technology. Desks and a stable electricity supply are luxuries.\n",

      "\"We didn't have enough desks last year,\" recalls Asmaa's 12-year-old neighbor, Omnia. \"So most of us just sat on the floor. We only get a little paper, but my mom found this,\" she said, holding up a small, faded \"Hannah Montana\" notebook. The American pop culture reference is lost on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make up for the gaps in education, millions of middle-class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25% -- on private tutoring. It's impossible to know how much money is spent in all, but some estimates put the total at $1 billion a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public school teachers rarely make more than $300 a month. More than a few of them say they teach the bare minimum in class so that they can earn more from the same students in private tutoring sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are too many issues to deal with,\" said one 32-year-old teacher in Asmaa's village. \"I have kids of my own I'm struggling to take care for.\" He says he gives three hours of private tutoring in the evening and does mechanical work on the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "For parents with any hope that their children will be better off, investing in education is essential. Egypt's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students. Their scores chart their future. If they don't do well, they won't get a place in college.\n",
      "\n",
      "The status quo is even more somber for Egypt's women. According to a recent World Bank report, the illiteracy rate for young people in Upper Egypt is 17%, higher than the national average of 11%, and the illiteracy rates for females is 24%, almost twice that of males. Also, 70% of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless.\n",
