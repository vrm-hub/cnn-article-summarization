# Text Summarization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an evaluation-based text summarization system using pre-trained models like BERT and a custom Seq2Seq model. The project aims to compare performance and potentially add a query-based summarization feature for enhanced user interaction.

## Data
The project utilizes the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, chosen for its structured summaries and computational feasibility. This dataset offers a balance between complexity and performance.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- NLTK or spaCy

## Models
- Pre-trained BERT models for contextual understanding and benchmarking.
- Custom Seq2Seq model with an attention mechanism for generating summaries.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/text-summarization-project.git
   cd text-summarization-project
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - `requirements.txt` should contain all necessary libraries like `transformers`, `nltk`, `spacy`, etc.

4. **Download and Set Up the Dataset:**
   - The CNN/Daily Mail dataset can be accessed and downloaded via Hugging Face's datasets library.
   - Installation: `pip install datasets`
   - In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, you can load the dataset as follows:
     ```python
     from datasets import load_dataset
     dataset = load_dataset("cnn_dailymail", "3.0.0")
     ```

5. **Additional Setup:**
   - Additional steps such as downloading specific models or tokenizer from Hugging Face or setting up environment variables.
